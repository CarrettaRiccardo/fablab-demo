This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## ⚠️ Notes

The fake database is `in-memory`:

- In local development, the fake database is shared between apis and pages.
- In production, the fake database is separate between apis and pages.

This results in `CSR` always working correctly in development.

`SSR` and `ISR` only work as expected in production, as stated in docs: `"In Development, Pages are always rendered on-demand and are never cached. This allows you to see changes immediately without waiting for a revalidation period to pass."`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
